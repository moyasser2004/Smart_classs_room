IoT Classroom

A smart classroom project developed using Flutter, Clean Architecture, and IoT technologies. This project integrates various IoT devices, such as light sensors and ESP32 modules, with a Flutter app to monitor and control the classroom environment. Firebase is used for backend services, including real-time database and authentication.

Overview
The IoT Classroom project aims to create a connected classroom environment where teachers and students can interact with devices such as lights, fans, projectors, and more, all through a mobile app. The project showcases the use of MQTT for real-time communication between the app and IoT devices, along with a robust architecture using Clean Architecture principles.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Monitor classroom conditions like light intensity, temperature, and humidity.
Device Control: Control various classroom devices such as lights and fans directly from the app.
MQTT Integration: Seamless communication with IoT devices using MQTT.
Firebase Integration: Use Firebase Realtime Database for storing and syncing data, and Firebase Authentication for user management.
Clean Architecture: Well-organized codebase following Clean Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
Responsive UI: A user-friendly and responsive interface designed using Flutter.
